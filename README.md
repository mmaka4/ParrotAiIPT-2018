# ParrotAiIPT-2018
The Artificial Intelligence Practical training &amp; Machine Learning activities.
On the first week of ParrotaiIPT 2018, I have been through many things and learned a lot of stuffs from reading books such as Hand On Machine Learning and, Introduction to Machine Learning with Python. Also I had a lot of practicals on implementing these theories that I have been reading them from the book. The key concepts that I have achieved through this week are as follows.
  * General introduction of machine learning
  * The categories of machine learning 
    * Supervised Machine learning
    * Unsupervised Machine learning
    * Semisupervised Machine learning and
    * Reinforcement 

But on this week I learned and practised Supervised machine learning techniques/algorithms.
Which are:-
* Linear regression
* k-Nearest Neighbor
* Decision trees
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Simple Vector Machine (SVMs)

Before dealing with your model you have to spend time to perform data cleaning. So, have been learning on how to clean my data before applying my algorithm. The process may involves the following activities: 
* To know the size, shape, features of your dataset that working with.
* To check to see if there are any missing values, and there are then fix them by removing that feature, or eliminating rows(instances) that have missing values on some attributes (features).
* Change the categorical values from some features in to numerical, if your model needs to work with numerical values only. It helps when finding how features they correlate on the dataset.

I also learned on how to choose important features which will result my model to be more efficient on training. I used the RandomForest model to see and choose important features according to my target from my dataset.

At last on the weekend, I had a week 1 challenge which I have been solving the problem of predicting whether a student will drop or continue with school according to the given dataset. So I have been apply my machine learning knowledge that I achieved on this first week.
